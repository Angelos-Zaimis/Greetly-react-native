Start by picking a bank that fits your needs; If you're staying for more than three months, ensure you have your residence permit in order. As an EU citizen, you'll need to register with the local office upon arrival.Make sure to have your passport or ID card ready, along with proof of employment in Switzerland, such as a job contract. You'll also need to show where you're living in Switzerland, so have a utility bill or rental agreement handy. Visiting a bank branch can be really helpful, as it gives you a chance to understand the account features and ask any questions. Be prepared to make an initial deposit if required, and decide what kind of account you need, whether it's for daily transactions or saving up. Always read the fine print to be aware of any fees or rules.Keep in mind that each bank might have its own set of requirements, so checking their website or calling them up is a good idea.
