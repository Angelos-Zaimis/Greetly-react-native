    "openBankAccountEmployeeEU": "As an EU citizen employed and aiming to open a bank account in Zurich, Switzerland, start by picking a suitable bank. Most banks will require an appointment, which you can set up online or over the phone. Having proof of employment and residence, either in Switzerland or the EU, is crucial for many banks. Arrive on time for your appointment, as Swiss culture values punctuality. At the bank, you'll fill out application forms, after which the bank will verify your details, a process that can take a few hours to days. Once verified, your account gets activated. Note that an initial deposit might be needed for some banks.For a detailed list of the necessary documentation, please click on the button at the bottom left of this page."
